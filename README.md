# VaccineScraper
 Screen scraping script developed to quickly book COVID-19 Vaccine

I developed this quick screen scraping python script to automate checking the COVID-19 vaccination webpage for my grandparents. The script opens the desired webpage, checks for an open appointment, and sends an email alerting the desired user if such an opening exists. 

This script utilizes Beautiful Soup 4 and Python 3.9 and was developed in IDLE.

I used a Raspberry Pi to run the script every 10 minutes as a CRONtab, and my grandparents were successfully able to book a spot despite heavy traffic and high demand. 

Please note that for privacy reasons, I have replaced my Gmail auth key with filler text, as well as the desired emails. Please fill these in accordingly if you wish to adapt the script for your needs.

If you use this script, please email me at henryanderson@engineer.com
I would be happy to know it helped others!
